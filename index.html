    <h2> About me </h2>
    <p1> Hi there! My name is Luxshie, but you can call me Lux. I was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, and have never lived elsewhere. <br>
        That is until a few weeks ago, when I moved to Ottawa to begin the Interactive Media Design Program here at Algonquin. <br> 
        It's been a smooth transition so far, and I am looking forward to what the next two years in a new city will bring! <br> 
        I definetly feel like Ottawa is more my pace, and I also am enjoying being pushed out of my comfort zone a bit by moving here alone. <br> 
        I am the youngest child of three, so I am used to being coddled by my caring, but at times overbearing, older siblings and parents. <br> 
        I'm hopeful that this newfound independence will be worthwhile, and I might come out of this experience learning some new skills, like cooking. <br>
        </p1> <br> 
        
        <p2> Some of my interests outside of school include writing, reading and art. And if you haven't guessed already from that triad of hobbies, <br> 
        I am an introvert. Creative writing is something i have been doing for as long as I can remember, but have only taken up more seriously in recent years. <br> 
        I now spend much of my spare time working on poetry or short fiction pieces for grants that are offered by local magazines/companies. <br> 
        While I enjoy painting, it's not something i've done much of over the past year, and I am hoping to get back into it now that I'm in Ottawa. <br> 
        My favourite TV show is and will likely always be One Tree Hill, and I have the 23 Scott Jersey to prove it.   </p2> 
    <h3> My favourite quote </h3>
    <p3> "It's the oldest story in the book. One day you're seventeen and you're planning for some day. And then quietly without you ever noticing, someday is today. <br>
        And then someday is yesterday. And this is your life" </p3>
